# Bellabeat-Marketing-Analysis
In this case study, I will perform data analysis for Bellabeat, a high-tech manufacturer of health-focused products for women. Bellabeat is a successful small company, 
but they have the potential to become a larger player in the global smart device market. I focused my analysis on one of Bellabeatâ€™s products, the Bellabeat app, 
which provides users with health data related to their activity, sleep, stress, menstrual cycle, and mindfulness habits. The Bellabeat app connects to their line of smart 
wellness products and accumulates data through those products.

I will analyze smart device data to gain insights into how consumers are using their smart devices. My analysis will help guide future marketing strategies 
for the Bellabeat team. With the future adjustments made to the marketing strategy, we will ideally see an increase in sales and a higher consumer interest in Bellabeat 
products than in other smart devices.
